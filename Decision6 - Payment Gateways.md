## Status
Proposed

## Context

The app aims to provide a secure, smooth, and reliable payment experience to its users. The choice of payment gateways is crucial to uphold these standards and to comply with financial regulations.

## Decision

PayPal is a popular payment method, but thinking of highly use acceptance we decided to use Stripe and PayPal together for the payment gateway.

## Consequences/Rationale

Stripe and PayPal are widely recognized, trusted, and provide a seamless user experience. Integrating both gives more payment options to the users.
