# Permissions

## Status
Proposed

## Context

User privacy and trust are paramount, especially in a retail app handling user data and transactions. The permissions model should align with these principles while still allowing the app to function as intended.

## Decision

Minimal Permissions

## Consequences/Rationale

Requesting minimal permissions is essential for building trust with the user. Only essential permissions like internet, push notifications, and possibly location (for regional offers) should be requested.
