# Backend Language

## Status
Proposed

## Context

The backend needs to handle a large number of concurrent requests efficiently, especially during sales or promotional events. Additionally, a language with a strong ecosystem and support for modern development practices and tools is preferred.

## Decision

We have decided to use Node.js as the app's backend language.

## Consequences/Rationale

Node.js is known for its performance and scalability. Its asynchronous, non-blocking nature is suitable for handling multiple concurrent client requests efficiently.
