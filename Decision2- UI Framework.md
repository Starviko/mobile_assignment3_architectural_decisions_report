# UI Framework

## Status
Proposed

## Context

The project timeline, budget, and the necessity for a consistent and engaging user interface across both Android and iOS platforms necessitated the selection of a UI framework that could deliver on these requirements while minimizing development and maintenance efforts.

## Decision

We have decided to use React Native to create the UI of our native mobile app.

## Consequences/Rationale

React Native provides a near-native performance and look-and-feel while allowing for code sharing between iOS and Android, which can speed up development and reduce maintenance costs.
