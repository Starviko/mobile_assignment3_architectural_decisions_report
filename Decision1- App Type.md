# Developing a new mobile app for a retail company

## Status
Proposed

## Context

The retail app requires a smooth user interface, offline mode, push notifications, and needs to cater to a wide audience across different mobile platforms. A decision needed to be made between native, web, or hybrid app based on these requirements and the potential future needs of scaling and maintenance.

## Decision

We have decided to create a Native App.

## Consequences/Rationale

Native apps provide a better performance, access to device-specific features, and a more fluid user experience. This is crucial for features like offline mode, push notifications, and smooth rendering of product images.
